; -- unlockConfig.def parameters:
; -- * name: 
;      The name of the char to be unlocked with the command. It must match exactly how it is written in select.def, e.g., kfm, Elecbyte/kfm.

; -- * command: 
;      Write here the command to unlock the char (in the same format as commands are written in the char's CMD file), e.g., ~F,F,F,B,B,s.

; -- * holdstart: 
;      If set to 1, the command requires holding the start button to execute.

; -- * unlocked: 
;      If set to true, the char will be unlocked by default.

; -- * unlocksnd: 
;      Group, index and volume of the sound to be played when the command is executed. Sounds must be added to unlockCmdSounds.snd, e.g., 1,0,100.

; -- * hidden: 
;      If true, the cell will remain invisible, valid values are 1 (true) or 0 (false).

; -- * keep:
;      If true, will keep the char unlocked after closing the game, valid values are 1 (true) or 0 (false).

; -- * anim: 
;      Group and index of the sprite to be used as the char's portrait when locked. If omitted, the default random select icon from the portrait will be used.
; --   This uses the standard .air syntax, allowing you to specify a single sprite or define an anim, e.g.:
; --   anim = 1,0, 0,0, 10
; --          1,1, 0,0, 10
; --   You must add your sprites to unlockCmdSprites.sff.
; --
; -- EXAMPLE (in select.def):
; -- kfmZ, hidden = 2, unlock = UnlockCmd("kfmZ")
